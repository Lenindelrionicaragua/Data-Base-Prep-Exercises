Prep Exercise Week 4

1 - What are the collections?
2 - What information will you embed in a document, and which will you store normalized?

    A: I will have two collections. The first, "Recipes," will contain fields such as name and instructions. I have embedded recipe details and ingredient quantities (which will reference ingredients). The second collection will be "Ingredients," which will have ingredient details also embedded.

    This simple division facilitates easy understanding of information and also streamlines data insertion. However, by keeping ingredients separate, it makes it easy to search for recipes by common ingredients and also expedites ingredient updates, ensuring they swiftly reflect in their respective recipes.

DISCUSSION:

3 - What made you decide when to embed information? What assumptions did you make?

    A: I assumed that queries on this type of data would not be very complex, so I opted for embedding instead of normalizing information. To decide where to embed the information, I considered the proximity of the data; for example, ingredient quantity is closely tied to the recipe, as are recipe details.

4 - If you were given MySQL and MongoDB as choices to build the recipe's database at the beginning, which one would you choose and why?

    Personally, I prefer MySQL because it seems clearer and more secure for data storage, and I appreciate its consistency and durability. However, in this case, dealing with a not very complex database, MongoDB is a good option.
